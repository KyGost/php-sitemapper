An XML sitemapper, place into your root (public_html) folder and go to the URL, '[domain]/sitemapper'.

If you want to simply view all files as their links, go to the plain URL, if you want to view the XML file, go to '[domain]/sitemapper?xml'; if you want to update your sitemap, go to '[domain]/sitemapper?xml&update'.

The updated sitemap will be the 'sitemap.xml' file in the directory that your sitemaper is in.
